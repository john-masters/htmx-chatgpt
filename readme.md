# AI CHAT

## About

This is a blatant copy of chat gpt using gpt-4. I just made this as it's cheaper than paying for the chat gpt subscription.

## Set-up

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the `src/.env.example` file in the to `src/.env` and fill in the necessary values

## Usage

1. Run locally: `docker-compose up`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Use like chat gpt
